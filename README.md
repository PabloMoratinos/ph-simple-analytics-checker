2. Unzip it on your computer.
3. Open Chrome and type chrome://extensions in the address bar. Press Enter.
4. Enable Developer Mode using the toggle in the top right corner.

6. Use the extension by clicking on it to open the side panel.

## Usage tips:

The extension checks for scripts when the page loads. On low-performance sites, it's a good idea to refresh the scan using the Refresh analysis button, in case some scripts take longer than usual to load. This might be a sign of potential tracking losses.
